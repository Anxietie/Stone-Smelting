# STONE SMELTING

## Features
There's the blast furnace for ores, the smoker for food, 
so why not another one for stones? The melter is a furnace 
variant that smelts the stone (and glass) recipes faster
(e.g. cobblestone -> stone -> smooth_stone)

## Compatibility
Only the vanilla stone smelting recipes can be melted. However, 
other mods can just create a recipe json for their stone smelting
recipe:
```json
{
  "type": "melting:melting",
  "...": "..."
}
```
